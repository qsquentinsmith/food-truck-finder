# Food Truck Finder
## Author: Quentin Smith

### Introduction: 
The Minneapolis and St. Paul metro area do not have a free open source project for locating food trucks. I have found no single application that will list all of the food trucks within the cities and map them for me. This is due to the ever changing locations and times of the food trucks. Not to mention that the updates don't come in a single location usually they are updated on the company website, twitter, facebook, or instagram. 

The current solutions to this issue require food trucks to pay a few to be listed on the website that will map their whereabouts. 

### Goal:
I am creating a free Twin Cities food truck finder based on Open Government Data.
